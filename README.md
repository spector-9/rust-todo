# TODO in Rust
This is a simple application to manage calcurse's todo file.
This application only edit the file to display you have to use calcurse or add print in the source yourself.
It is not written with idiomatic rust because I first wanted to learn the basic rust and get my hands dirty.

To use

```
cargo run -- [a|d] [priority|index to delete] [item to add in string form]
```
